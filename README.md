Introduction to Web Assembly 


## What is WebAssembly?
From the Website:

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

## So what does it let you do?
Lets you run whatever langulage you want in the browser as long as its wasm compilable!

### Some impressive example projects:
1. Run Emulators in Rust for the browser: https://github.com/andrewimm/wasm-gb
2. A Progressive Web App terminal: https://github.com/wasmerio/webassembly.sh
4. Lots of things: https://madewithwebassembly.com/
5. Yet more projects: https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm


## Projects that you can run right now!
